              By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically
              apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them
              carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or
              modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way.
              You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the
              app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate thee app into other
              languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all
              the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual
              property rights related to it, still belong to Tijs Martens.
            </P>
            <P>
              Tijs Martens is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful
              and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right
              to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
              time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or
              its services without making it very clear to you exactly what
              you’re paying for.
            </P>
            <P>
              The Rodi app stores and processes personal data that you have
              provided to us, in order to provide my Service. It’s your
              responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
              therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone,
              which is the process of removing software restrictions and
              limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
              device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
              malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
              security features and it could mean that the Rodi app won’t work
              properly or at all.
            </P>
            <P>
              The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms
              and Conditions.

              You should be aware that there are certain things that Tijs
              Martens will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the
              app will require the app to have an active internet connection.
              The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network
              provider, but Tijs Martens cannot take responsibility for the app
              not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to
              Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
            </P>
            <P>
              If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
              remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
              provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
              mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
              connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges.
              In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
              charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside
              of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning
              off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
              which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that
              you have received permission from the bill payer for using the
              app.
            </P>
            <P>
              Along the same lines, Tijs Martens cannot always take
              responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make
              sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery
              and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Tijs Martens cannot
              accept responsibility.
            </P>
            <P>
              With respect to Tijs Martens’s responsibility for your use of the
              app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind
              that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
              correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
              information to us so that we can make it available to you. Tijs
              Martens accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
              experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of
              the app.
            </P>
            <P>
              At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
              available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for both
              systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
              availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to
              download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Tijs
              Martens does not promise that it will always update the app so
              that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS
              version that you have installed on your device. However, you
              promise to always accept updates to the application when offered
              to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may
              terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of
              termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
              termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
              terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
              delete it from your device.
